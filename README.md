# face_authorization


My task was to create an automated security system that identifies people by their faces. It can be useful in various fields, from personal use to industrial or corporate use. I developed it for personal use because I became interested in its construction and functioning principle. Currently, I use it to access my computer through the webcam. I trained the model based on input data provided in the form of images with different projections and photographs of the same person from various angles. It is also planned to investigate how the neural network method performs compared to the p-hash comparison method of these images. Additionally, the possibility of combining these two methods has been explored: embedding the neural network, transforming the feature space using hash functions into a vector, and directly comparing these vectors.
