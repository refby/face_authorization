# face_authorization


My objective was to establish an automated facial recognition security system applicable in various contexts, from personal usage to industrial and corporate applications. I initially developed this system for personal utilization due to my fascination with its construction and operational principles. I employ it to gain access to my computer via the webcam. The model was trained using input data comprising images from different angles and various snapshots of the same individual. Additionally, I intend to assess the performance of the neural network method in comparison to the perceptual hash-comparison technique for these images. Furthermore, I have explored the possibility of merging these two methods: embedding the neural network, converting the feature space into vectors using hash functions, and directly contrasting these vectors.
